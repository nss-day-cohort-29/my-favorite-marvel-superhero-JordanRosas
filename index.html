            Iron Man is my favorite suoer hero because he's a rarity in the world - that being a narsicist, 
            however, he saves citites all around the world and he doesnt turn into dust at the end of 
            infinity war. He seems to be the most versatile super heros due to the fact that he can fly and fight
            in just about any situtation. where as Other heros or better suited for certain types of situations,
            iron man can do it all.
